## Group info
* __Name__: Ensemble
* __Members__: [Eliseo Bao (CEO)](mailto:eliseo.bao@udc.es), [Diego Martínez (CTO)](mailto:diego.martinez.villar@udc.es), [María López (CDO, COO)](mailto:maria.lgarcia@udc.es), [Pedro Mauricio Echeverry (CXO)](mailto:mauricio.echeverry@udc.es)
* __App idea__: The basic idea of the application is to create a real-time tracking service that incorporates augmented reality. It is expected to be used by both delivery personnel and individuals who are expecting a package. A delivery person could use it to scan all the packages that she needs to deliver, so the application would allow her to view augmented reality data about the packages, as well as the optimal route for delivery. Another person who is waiting for the package could see the real-time location of her package on the map.
